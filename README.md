A collection of ADC(2) scripts with basic MPI parallelisation which were written for my research.
They are not fully featured, but should be reasonably efficient whilst remaining very lightweight.
For more robust implementations use [adcc](https://github.com/adc-connect/adcc) or the `pyscf.adc` [module](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/tree/master/pyscf/adc).
